Necessary factors:
1. The global economy remains stable.
2. No severe regulatory restrictions on Bitcoin are imposed by major economies.
3. There is no catastrophic failure of the Bitcoin network.
4. Bitcoin market participation continues to grow or at least remain stable.

Conditional probabilities:
1. P(The global economy remains stable)=0.8
2. P(No severe regulatory restrictions on Bitcoin are imposed by major economies|The global economy remains stable)=0.7
3. P(There is no catastrophic failure of the Bitcoin network|The global economy remains stable, No severe regulatory restrictions on Bitcoin are imposed by major economies)=0.98
4. P(Bitcoin market participation continues to grow or remain stable|There is no catastrophic failure of the Bitcoin network, No severe regulatory restrictions on Bitcoin are imposed by major economies, The global economy remains stable)=0.9

P(Q) = P(X₁) * P(X₂|X₁) * P(X₃|X₁, X₂) * P(X₄|X₁, X₂, X₃) = 0.8 * 0.7 * 0.98 * 0.9 = 0.491616

0.491616
