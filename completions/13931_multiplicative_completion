Necessary factors:
1. A nuclear-armed nation or actor decides to conduct a nuclear test or an accident occurs 
2. The nuclear weapon is successfully detonated

1. P(A nuclear-armed nation or actor decides to conduct a nuclear test or an accident occurs)=0.012
2. P(The weapon is successfully detonated|A nuclear-armed nation or actor decides to conduct a nuclear test or an accident occurs)=0.98

Multiplying the probabilities obtains the final probabilistic estimate: 
0.012*0.98=0.01176

0.01176
