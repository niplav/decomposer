Necessary factors:
1. A current Supreme Court justice either dies, resigns, retires or is impeached.
2. The succeeding nomination by the President is confirmed by the Senate.

1. P(A current Supreme Court justice either dies, resigns, retires or is impeached) = 0.3
2. P(The succeeding nomination by the President is confirmed by the Senate | A current Supreme Court justice either dies, resigns, retires or is impeached) = 0.85

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.3*0.85 = 0.255
0.255
