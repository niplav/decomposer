Necessary factors:
1. A direct attack on a NATO member state.
2. The attacked state requests assistance from NATO.
3. The North Atlantic Council voting unanimously to invoke Article 5.

1. P(A direct attack on a NATO member state)=0.05
2. P(The attacked state requests assistance from NATO|A direct attack on a NATO member state)=0.8
3. P(The North Atlantic Council voting unanimously to invoke Article 5|The attacked state requests assistance from NATO, A direct attack on a NATO member state)=0.7
Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.05*0.8*0.7=0.028
0.028
