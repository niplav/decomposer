3. No severe circumstances (like legal issues, government intervention, or bankruptcy) force Elon Musk to lose ownership of Twitter before January 1, 2024.

1. P(Elon Musk purchases Twitter before January 1, 2024)=0.1
2. P(Elon Musk keeps his ownership and does not sell Twitter before January 1, 2024|Elon Musk purchases Twitter before January 1, 2024)=0.95
3. P(No severe circumstances force Elon Musk to lose ownership of Twitter before January 1, 2024|Elon Musk keeps his ownership and does not sell Twitter before January 1, 2024)=0.98
Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.1*0.95*0.98=0.0931
