Necessary factors:
1. The prevalence of the H5N1 virus increases significantly.
2. The H5N1 virus evolves towards a more contagious strain.
3. There is human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus.
4. WHO is alerted about the severe changes to the H5N1 virus.
5. WHO determines the situation as severe enough to declare it a PHEIC.

1. P(The prevalence of the H5N1 virus increases significantly)=0.1
2. P(The H5N1 virus evolves towards a more contagious strain|The prevalence of the H5N1 virus increases significantly)=0.05
3. P(There is human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus|The H5N1 virus evolves towards a more contagious strain, The prevalence of the H5N1 virus increases significantly)=0.3
4. P(WHO is alerted about the severe changes to the H5N1 virus|There is human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus, The H5N1 virus evolves towards a more contagious strain, The prevalence of the H5N1 virus increases significantly)=0.95
5. P(WHO determines the situation as severe enough to declare it a PHEIC|WHO is alerted about the severe changes to the H5N1 virus, There is human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus, The H5N1 virus evolves towards a more contagious strain, The prevalence of the H5N1 virus increases significantly)=0.9
Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.1*0.05*0.3*0.95*0.9=0.0012825

0.0012825
