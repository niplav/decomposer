3. NATO country(s) have surplus F-16 fighter jets to allocate to Ukraine.
4. Political and strategic reviews by NATO country(s) approve the dispatch of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine.

Probabilities:
1. P(NATO perceives threat from opposing factions that warrant sending fighter jets)=0.60
2. P(Ukraine requests for or agrees to the provision of F-16 fighter jets|NATO perceives threat from opposing factions that warrant sending fighter jets)=0.70
3. P(NATO country(s) have surplus F-16 fighter jets to allocate to Ukraine|Ukraine requests for or agrees to the provision of F-16 fighter jets, NATO perceives threat from opposing factions that warrant sending fighter jets)=0.80
4. P(Political and strategic reviews by NATO country(s) approve the dispatch of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine|NATO country(s) have surplus F-16 fighter jets to allocate to Ukraine, Ukraine requests for or agrees to the provision of F-16 fighter jets, NATO perceives threat from opposing factions that warrant sending fighter jets)=0.50

P(Q) = 0.60 * 0.70 * 0.80 * 0.50 = 0.168
