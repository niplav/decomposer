Necessary factors:
1. There is a relevant affirmative action case accepted by the Supreme Court in 2023.
2. The Supreme Court holds a conservative majority in 2023.
3. The majority of the conservative court justices decide to rule against affirmative action.

1. P(There is a relevant affirmative action case accepted by the Supreme Court in 2023) = 0.15
2. P(The Supreme Court holds a conservative majority in 2023|There is a relevant affirmative action case accepted by the Supreme Court in 2023) = 0.8
3. P(The majority of the conservative court justices decide to rule against affirmative action|The Supreme Court holds a conservative majority, There is a relevant affirmative action case) = 0.65
Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.15*0.8*0.65 = 0.078

0.078
