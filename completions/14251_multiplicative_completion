Necessary factors:
1. There is no major escalation of hostilities between Ukraine and Russia that results in loss of control over Zaporizhzhia.
2. Internal political stability is maintained within Ukraine to effectively govern Zaporizhzhia.
3. No significant internal separatist movements emerge in Zaporizhzhia advocating for a change in control.

1. P(No major escalation of hostilities between Ukraine and Russia)=0.8
2. P(Internal political stability within Ukraine|No major escalation of hostilities between Ukraine and Russia)=0.9
3. P(No significant internal separatist movements in Zaporizhzhia|No major escalation of hostilities between Ukraine and Russia, Internal political stability within Ukraine)=0.95
Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.8*0.9*0.95=0.684.
