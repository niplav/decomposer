1. P(Stability of the political climate in Ukraine)=0.6
2. P(No unforeseen international incidents interfere with Ukraine's election schedule|Stability of the political climate in Ukraine)=0.75
3. P(The election infrastructure and administrative procedures remain intact and operational|No unforeseen international incidents interfere with Ukraine's election schedule, Stability of the political climate in Ukraine)=0.9
4. P(The Ukrainian population is able to participate in the elections to meet the required minimum turnout|The election infrastructure and administrative procedures remain intact and operational, No unforeseen international incidents interfere with Ukraine's election schedule, Stability of the political climate in Ukraine)=0.95
Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.6*0.75*0.9*0.95=0.382725
