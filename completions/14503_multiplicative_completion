Necessary factors:

1. The political environment is such that increasing or suspending the debt limit is seen as necessary (i.e., there is substantial national debt and the limit is close to being reached).
2. There is enough support in the Congress to pass a bill increasing or suspending the debt limit.
3. The President signs off on the bill to increase or suspend the debt limit.

1. P(Political environment is such that increasing or suspending the debt limit is seen as necessary before 2024)=0.95
2. P(There is enough support in Congress to pass a bill increasing or suspending the debt limit|Political environment is such that increasing or suspending the debt limit is seen as necessary)=0.9
3. P(The President signs off on the bill to increase or suspend the debt limit|There is enough support in Congress to pass a bill increasing or suspending the debt limit, Political environment is such that increasing or suspending the debt limit is seen as necessary)=0.95

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.95*0.9*0.95=0.81075
0.81075
