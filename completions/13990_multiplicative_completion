Necessary factors:
1. There is an explosion in COVID-19 cases within China.
2. Testing and reporting capabilities are sufficiently robust to confirm 25 million+ cases.
3. The Chinese authorities transparently report the confirmed cases to the global community.

1. P(There is an explosion in COVID-19 cases within China)=0.3
2. P(Testing and reporting capabilities are sufficiently robust to confirm 25 million+ cases|There is an explosion in COVID-19 cases within China)=0.9
3. P(The Chinese authorities transparently report the confirmed cases to the global community|Testing and reporting capabilities are sufficiently robust to confirm 25 million+ cases, There is an explosion in COVID-19 cases within China)=0.5

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.3*0.9*0.5 = 0.135
0.135
