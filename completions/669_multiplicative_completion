Necessary factors:
1. KIC 9832227 is well on its way to merger, as indicated by existing observational data.
2. The observed trend in the orbital period decrease of KIC 9832227 continues.
3. No external forces significantly disturb the system before the merger.
4. The merger process results in a "red nova" bright enough to be observable to the naked eye on Earth.

1. P(KIC 9832227 is well on its way to merger, as indicated by existing observational data)=0.9
2. P(The observed trend in the orbital period decrease of KIC 9832227 continues|KIC 9832227 is well on its way to merger)=0.8
3. P(No external forces significantly disturb the system before the merger| The observed trend in the orbital period decrease of KIC 9832227 continues, KIC 9832227 is well on its way to merger)=0.95
4. P(The merger process results in a "red nova" bright enough to be observable to the naked eye on Earth|No external forces significantly disturb the system before the merger, The observed trend in the orbital period decrease of KIC 9832227 continues, KIC 9832227 is well on its way to merger)=0.7
Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.9*0.8*0.95*0.7=0.4788

0.4788
