Necessary factors:
1. Political will to remove cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substance Act.
2. Passage of a bill, either standalone or embedded in another bill, declassifying cannabis from Schedule I.
3. The President signing the bill into law or the bill passing the veto by receiving more than two-thirds of votes in both the House and Senate.

1. P(Political will to remove cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substance Act)=0.6
2. P(Passage of a bill, either standalone or embedded in another bill, declassifying cannabis from Schedule I | Political will to remove cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substance Act)=0.4
3. P(The President signing the bill into law or the bill passing the veto by receiving more than two-thirds of votes in both the House and Senate | Passage of a bill, either standalone or embedded in another bill, declassifying cannabis from Schedule I)=0.9

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.6*0.4*0.9=0.216
0.216
