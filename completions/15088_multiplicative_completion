Necessary factors:
1. The U.S. government's fiscal deficit significantly increases.
2. The U.S. government's debt-to-GDP ratio significantly increases.
3. The U.S. GDP growth slows down significantly.
4. There's a serious political gridlock that negatively impacts the economy.
5. There's a significant economic crisis in the country.
6. The Federal Reserve increases interest rates substantially.

1. P(U.S. fiscal deficit significantly increases) = 0.2
2. P(U.S. government's debt-to-GDP ratio significantly increases|U.S. fiscal deficit significantly increases) = 0.6
3. P(U.S. GDP growth slows down significantly|U.S. government's debt-to-GDP ratio significantly increases, U.S. fiscal deficit significantly increases) = 0.4
4. P(Serious political gridlock that negatively impacts the economy|U.S. GDP growth slows down significantly, U.S. government's debt-to-GDP ratio significantly increases, U.S. fiscal deficit significantly increases) = 0.3
5. P(Significant economic crisis in the country|Serious political gridlock that negatively impacts the economy, U.S. GDP growth slows down significantly, U.S. government's debt-to-GDP ratio significantly increases, U.S. fiscal deficit significantly increases) = 0.25
6. P(Federal Reserve increases interest rates substantially|Significant economic crisis in the country, Serious political gridlock that negatively impacts the economy, U.S. GDP growth slows down significantly, U.S. government's debt-to-GDP ratio significantly increases, U.S. fiscal deficit significantly increases) = 0.2

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.2*0.6*0.4*0.3*0.25*0.2 = 0.00144
