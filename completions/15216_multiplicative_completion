Necessary factors:
1. Political willingness to increase or suspend the debt limit.
2. U.S. financial health and stability.
3. Proactive action from Treasury to stave off default.
4. Absence of major global or domestic economic shock.

1. P(Political willingness to increase or suspend the debt limit)=0.85
2. P(U.S. financial health and stability|Political willingness to increase or suspend the debt limit)=0.95
3. P(Proactive action from Treasury to stave off default|Political willingness to increase or suspend the debt limit, U.S. financial health and stability)=0.98
4. P(Absence of major global or domestic economic shock|Political willingness to increase or suspend the debt limit, U.S. financial health and stability, Proactive action from Treasury to stave off default)=0.9
Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.85*0.95*0.98*0.9=0.727065.
0.727065
