Necessary factors:
1. Erdogan chooses to run for the presidency.
2. Erdogan maintains sufficient popularity to gain majority or plurality of votes.
3. The election is free and fair and official results reflect the actual vote count.
4. External factors (such as economic, geopolitical, and health crises) do not adversely affect Erdogan's candidacy. 

1. P(Erdogan chooses to run for the presidency)=0.95
2. P(Erdogan maintains sufficient popularity to gain majority or plurality of votes | Erdogan chooses to run for the presidency) = 0.60
3. P(The election is free and fair and official results reflect the actual vote count | Erdogan maintains sufficient popularity) = 0.85
4. P(External factors (such as economic, geopolitical, and health crises) do not adversely affect Erdogan's candidacy | Erdogan maintains sufficient popularity, the election is free and fair) = 0.70
Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.95*0.60*0.85*0.70=0.35805

0.35805
