Necessary factors:
1. The political and military leadership in China decides to invade Taiwan.
2. There is no effective diplomatic intervention preventing the invasion.
3. China’s military has the capacity to successfully initiate a full-scale invasion.
4. Risks of international condemnation, sanctions, or military retaliation don't deter China.

1. P(The political and military leadership in China decides to invade Taiwan)=0.10
2. P(There is no effective diplomatic intervention preventing the invasion|The political and military leadership in China decides to invade Taiwan)=0.70
3. P(China’s military has the capacity to successfully initiate a full-scale invasion|There is no effective diplomatic intervention preventing the invasion, The political and military leadership in China decides to invade Taiwan)=0.95
4. P(Risks of international condemnation, sanctions, or military retaliation don't deter China|China’s military has the capacity to successfully initiate a full-scale invasion, There is no effective diplomatic intervention preventing the invasion, The political and military leadership in China decides to invade Taiwan)=0.80

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.10*0.70*0.95*0.80=0.0532

0.0532
