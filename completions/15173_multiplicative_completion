Necessary factors:
1. Ukraine and Russia agree to a ceasefire before 2024.
2. The agreed ceasefire holds and is respected by all parties involved.
3. Significant internal dissent grows within Russia.
4. This dissent escalates to the point of large-scale conflict.

1. P(Ukraine and Russia agree to a ceasefire before 2024)=0.4
2. P(The agreed ceasefire holds and is respected by all parties involved|Ukraine and Russia agree to a ceasefire before 2024)=0.5
3. P(Significant internal dissent grows within Russia|The agreed ceasefire holds and is respected by all parties involved, Ukraine and Russia agree to a ceasefire before 2024)=0.3
4. P(This dissent escalates to the point of large-scale conflict|Significant internal dissent grows within Russia, The agreed ceasefire holds and is respected by all parties involved, Ukraine and Russia agree to a ceasefire before 2024)=0.2
Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.4*0.5*0.3*0.2=0.012
0.012
