Necessary factors:
1. Israel's lunar mission launches successfully.
2. The spacecraft makes it to the Moon.
3. The actual soft landing on the Moon is successful.
4. No other country soft-lands on the Moon before Israel.

1. P(Israel's lunar mission launches successfully)=0.90
2. P(The spacecraft makes it to the Moon|Israel's lunar mission launches successfully)=0.85
3. P(The actual soft landing on the Moon is successful|The spacecraft makes it to the Moon, Israel's lunar mission launches successfully)=0.75
4. P(No other country soft-lands on the Moon before Israel|The actual soft landing on the Moon is successful, The spacecraft makes it to the Moon, Israel's lunar mission launches successfully)=0.6

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.90*0.85*0.75*0.6=0.3645
0.3645
