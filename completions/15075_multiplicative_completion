Necessary factors:
1. A bird flu subtype emerges that can infect minks.
2. The new bird flu subtype spreads to at least one mink farm.
3. Regulatory authorities decide to cull the infected minks.

1. P(A bird flu subtype emerges that can infect minks)=0.6
2. P(The new bird flu subtype spreads to at least one mink farm|A bird flu subtype emerges that can infect minks)=0.4
3. P(Regulatory authorities decide to cull the infected minks|The new bird flu subtype spreads to at least one mink farm, A bird flu subtype emerges that can infect minks)=0.95

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.6*0.4*0.95=0.228
0.228
