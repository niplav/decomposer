1. P(The US government runs out of money to service its debt)=0.02
2. P(The US government fails to raise the debt ceiling|The US government runs out of money to service its debt)=0.25
3. P(There is an impasse in political negotiations to address the debt ceiling and/or fiscal policy|The US government fails to raise the debt ceiling, The US government runs out of money to service its debt)=0.6
4. P(The President or Secretary of the Treasury makes a decision not to prioritize debt payments|There is an impasse in political negotiations to address the debt ceiling and/or fiscal policy, The US government fails to raise the debt ceiling, The US government runs out of money to service its debt)=0.1
5. P(Major credit ratings agencies identify a default on US sovereign debt obligations|The President or Secretary of the Treasury makes a decision not to prioritize debt payments, There is an impasse in political negotiations to address the debt ceiling and/or fiscal policy, The US government fails to raise the debt ceiling, The US government runs out of money to service its debt)=0.95

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.02*0.25*0.6*0.1*0.95=0.00285
