Necessary factors:
1. There's an event that could potentially cause the destruction of the Kerch Bridge.
2. This event actually occurs.
3. The event successfully destroys the Kerch Bridge.
4. The bridge isn't repaired before January 1, 2024 such that vehicles can pass over it.

Conditional probabilities:
1. P(There's an event that could potentially cause the destruction of the Kerch Bridge) = 0.2
2. P(This event actually occurs | There's an event that could potentially cause the destruction of the Kerch Bridge) = 0.1
3. P(The event destroys the Kerch Bridge | This event actually occurs and there's an event that can destroy the Kerch Bridge) = 0.7
4. P(The bridge isn't repaired before January 1, 2024 such that vehicles can pass over it | The event destroys the Kerch Bridge) = 0.3

P(Q) = P(There's an event that could potentially cause the destruction of the Kerch Bridge) * 
         P(This event actually occurs | There's an event that could potentially cause the destruction of the Kerch Bridge) * 
         P(The event destroys the Kerch Bridge | This event actually occurs and there's an event that can destroy Kerch Bridge) * 
         P(The bridge isn't repaired before January 1, 2024 such that vehicles can pass over it | The event destroys the Kerch Bridge)

As such,

P(Q)=0.2*0.1*0.7*0.3 =  0.0042

0.0042
