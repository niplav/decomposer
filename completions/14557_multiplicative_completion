Necessary factors:
1. There is unresolved disagreement over budgetary allocations among key stakeholders.
2. The Congress fails to enact regular appropriations or a continuing resolution before the budgetary deadline.
3. The President doesn't intervene to prevent the shutdown.

1. P(There is unresolved disagreement over budgetary allocations among key stakeholders)=0.4
2. P(The Congress fails to enact regular appropriations or a continuing resolution before the budgetary deadline|There is unresolved disagreement over budgetary allocations among key stakeholders)=0.5
3. P(The President doesn't intervene to prevent the shutdown|The Congress fails to enact regular appropriations or a continuing resolution before the budgetary deadline, There is unresolved disagreement over budgetary allocations among key stakeholders)=0.3

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.4*0.5*0.3=0.06
0.06
