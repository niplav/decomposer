Necessary factors:
1. There is a clear successor agreed upon by Erdoğan's party.
2. Public pressure and sentiment strongly favor abdication.
3. There is no viable legal or political means for Erdoğan to contest the election result.
4. There's international pressure for him to concede defeat.

1. P(There is a clear successor agreed upon by Erdoğan's party)=0.7
2. P(Public pressure and sentiment strongly favor abdication|There is a clear successor agreed upon by Erdoğan's party)=0.65
3. P(There is no viable legal or political means for Erdoğan to contest the election result|Public pressure and sentiment strongly favor abdication, There is a clear successor agreed upon by Erdoğan's party)=0.6
4. P(There's international pressure for him to concede defeat|There is no viable legal or political means for Erdoğan to contest the election result, Public pressure and sentiment strongly favor abdication, There is a clear successor agreed upon by Erdoğan's party)=0.75

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.7*0.65*0.6*0.75=0.19575

0.19575
