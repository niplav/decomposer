Necessary factors:
1. The FTX Foundation disbursement grants to a recipient.
2. The grant recipient engages in illegal activity related to the grant or the FTX group of entities.
3. The illegal activity is discovered and reported to authorities or the FTX Foundation.
4. Authorities or the FTX Foundation take action to freeze, seize, or demand back the grant funds.

1. P(The FTX Foundation disbursements grants to a recipient)=1 (given)
2. P(The grant recipient engages in illegal activity|The FTX Foundation disbursements grants to a recipient)=0.01 (uncertainty factor based on average of fraud rate in non-profit sector)
3. P(The illegal activity is discovered and reported|The recipient engages in illegal activity)=0.2 (estimating a 20% chance that the illegal activity would be discovered and reported)
4. P(Authorities or the FTX Foundation take action|The illegal activity is discovered and reported)=0.8 (assuming good regulatory oversight and actions taken in case of illegal activity)

Multiplying out the probabilities: 1*0.01*0.2*0.8=0.0016
0.0016
