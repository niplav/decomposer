Necessary factors:
1. A promising image model candidate is developed and made available by 2023.
2. The model can adequately demonstrate performance in the realm of compositionality.
3. Scott Alexander acknowledges and tests this model.
4. The model passes Scott Alexander’s tests.
5. The results of the test impresses Edwin Chen.

1. P(A promising image model candidate is developed and made available by 2023) = 0.80
2. P(The model can adequately demonstrate performance in the realm of compositionality| A promising image model candidate is developed and made available by 2023) = 0.65
3. P(Scott Alexander acknowledges and tests this model| The model can adequately demonstrate performance in the realm of compositionality) = 0.85 
4. P(The model passes Scott Alexander’s tests|Scott Alexander acknowledges and tests this model) = 0.75
5. P(The results of the test impresses Edwin Chen|The model passes Scott Alexander’s tests) = 0.90

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.80*0.65*0.85*0.75*0.90 = 0.296355

0.296355
