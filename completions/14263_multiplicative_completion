1. P(Positive performance of the global economy)=0.6
2. P(Stability and growth in the Chinese economy|Positive performance of the global economy)=0.75
3. P(Favorable Chinese governmental policies on stock market|Stability and growth in the Chinese economy, Positive performance of the global economy)=0.7
4. P(Absence of major global geopolitical conflicts|Favorable Chinese governmental policies on stock market, Stability and growth in the Chinese economy, Positive performance of the global economy)= 0.7

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.6*0.75*0.7*0.7=0.2205
