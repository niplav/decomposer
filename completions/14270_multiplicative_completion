Necessary factors:
1. SpaceX continues operations without significant interruptions.
2. SpaceX's Starship completes necessary ground tests.
3. SpaceX's Starship successfully achieves necessary regulatory approvals.
4. SpaceX successfully launches Starship and it reaches orbit.

1. P(SpaceX continues operations without significant interruptions)=0.96
2. P(SpaceX's Starship completes necessary ground tests|SpaceX continues operations without significant interruptions)=0.85
3. P(SpaceX's Starship successfully achieves necessary regulatory approvals|SpaceX's Starship completes necessary ground tests)=0.80
4. P(SpaceX successfully launches Starship and it reaches orbit|SpaceX's Starship successfully achieves necessary regulatory approvals)=0.75

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.96*0.85*0.80*0.75=0.4896
0.4896
