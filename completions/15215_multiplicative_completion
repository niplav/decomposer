Necessary factors:
1. The U.S. government fails to enact a "Plan B" to avoid default.
2. Market forces and governmental actors are unable (or unwilling) to absorb the resultant funding gap.
3. Global financial systems and institutions respond overwhelmingly negatively.
4. Other unforeseen aggravating factors occur, making the situation even worse.

1. P(The U.S. government fails to enact a "Plan B" to avoid default) = 0.15
2. P(Market forces and governmental actors are unable (or unwilling) to absorb the resultant funding gap|The U.S. government fails to enact a "Plan B" to avoid default) =0.5
3. P(Global financial systems and institutions respond overwhelmingly negatively|Market forces and governmental actors are unable (or unwilling) to absorb the resultant funding gap,The U.S. government fails to enact a "Plan B" to avoid default) =0.6
4. P(Other unforeseen aggravating factors occur, making the situation even worse|Global financial systems and institutions respond overwhelmingly negatively, Market forces and governmental actors are unable (or unwilling) to absorb the resultant funding gap,The U.S. government fails to enact a "Plan B" to avoid default) =0.2

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.15*0.5*0.6*0.2=0.009
0.009
