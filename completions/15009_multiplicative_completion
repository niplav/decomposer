Necessary factors:
1. Ukraine requests for F-22 or F-35 fighter jets.
2. The U.S. (or other countries with these jets) approves the request.
3. There are no significant international objections to the transfer.
4. There are no insurmountable logistical challenges to the transfer.

1. P(Ukraine requests for F-22 or F-35 fighter jets) = 0.6
2. P(The U.S. (or other countries with these jets) approves the request | Ukraine requests for F-22 or F-35 fighter jets) = 0.1
3. P(No significant international objections to the transfer | Ukraine requests for jets, The U.S. approves the request) = 0.7
4. P(No insurmountable logistical challenges to the transfer | No significant international objections, Ukraine requests for jets, The U.S. approves the request) = 0.9

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.6 * 0.1 * 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.0378

0.0378
