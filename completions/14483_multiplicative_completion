Necessary factors:
1. The Republicans form a majority in the House of Representatives.
2. A Republican member chooses to introduce a vacate motion.
3. The motion gets put on the House schedule for a vote.

1. P(The Republicans form a majority in the House of Representatives)=0.5
2. P(A Republican member chooses to introduce a vacate motion|The Republicans form a majority in the House of Representatives)=0.3
3. P(The motion gets put on the House schedule for a vote|A Republican member chooses to introduce a vacate motion, The Republicans form a majority in the House of Representatives)=0.9

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.5*0.3*0.9=0.135
0.135
