Necessary factors:
1. Tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalate to a conflict.
2. The conflict turns into a full-scale war.
3. Russia directs its military efforts towards capturing a large Ukrainian city.
4. Russia's military tactics are effective and successful in their strategy to capture or surround the city.
5. The city's defenses are unable to repel the Russian forces.
6. The international community does not intervene or their intervention is ineffective.

1. P(Tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalate to a conflict)=0.3
2. P(The conflict turns into a full-scale war|Tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalate to a conflict)=0.4
3. P(Russia directs its military efforts towards capturing a large Ukrainian city|The conflict turns into a full-scale war, Tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalate to a conflict)=0.7
4. P(Russia's military tactics are effective and successful in their strategy to capture or surround the city|Russia directs its military efforts towards capturing a large Ukrainian city, The conflict turns into a full-scale war, Tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalate to a conflict)=0.6
5. P(The city's defenses are unable to repel the Russian forces|Russia's military tactics are effective and successful in their strategy to capture or surround the city, Russia directs its military efforts towards capturing a large Ukrainian city, The conflict turns into a full-scale war, Tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalate to a conflict)=0.5
6. P(The international community does not intervene or their intervention is ineffective|The city's defenses are unable to repel the Russian forces, Russia's military tactics are effective and successful in their strategy to capture or surround the city, Russia directs its military efforts towards capturing a large Ukrainian city, The conflict turns into a full-scale war, Tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalate to a conflict)=0.9

Multiplying out the probabilities gives us P(Q): 0.3 * 0.4 * 0.7 * 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.9 = 0.02718
0.02718
