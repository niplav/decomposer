Necessary factors:
1. Existing technologies (e.g., fMRI, PET, EEG) or those under development can identify and quantify the neurological correlates of consciousness.
2. Scientific community, especially neuroscientists, have a consensus definition of "consciousness" that allows for empirical testing.
3. The scientific studies performed are peer-reviewed and broadly accepted in the neuroscience community.
4. The results of these studies are published in recognized scientific journals.

1. P(Existing technologies can identify and quantify the neurological correlates of consciousness)=0.7
2. P(Consensus definition of "consciousness" that allows for empirical testing|Existing technologies can identify and quantify the neurological correlates of consciousness)=0.6
3. P(The scientific studies are peer-reviewed and broadly accepted|Consensus definition of "consciousness", existing technologies)=0.8
4. P(The results are published in recognized scientific journals|The scientific studies are peer-reviewed, consensus definition, existing technologies)=0.95

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.7*0.6*0.8*0.95=0.3186
0.3186
