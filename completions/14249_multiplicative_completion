1. P(Ukraine decides to make a bid to control Sevastopol)=0.15
2. P(Ukraine manages to mobilize sufficient military resources for Sevastopol|Ukraine decides to make a bid to control Sevastopol)=0.7
3. P(Russia does not interfere significantly with Ukraine's bid|Ukraine manages to mobilize sufficient military resources for Sevastopol, Ukraine decides to make a bid to control Sevastopol)=0.1
4. P(Ukraine successfully takes control of the main train station|Russia does not interfere significantly with Ukraine's bid, Ukraine manages to mobilize sufficient military resources for Sevastopol, Ukraine decides to make a bid to control Sevastopol)=0.3
5. P(Ukraine maintains control of the key area until January 1, 2024|Ukraine successfully takes control of the main train station, Russia does not interfere significantly with Ukraine's bid, Ukraine manages to mobilize sufficient military resources for Sevastopol, Ukraine decides to make a bid to control Sevastopol)=0.8

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.15*0.7*0.1*0.3*0.8=0.00252
