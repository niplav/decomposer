Necessary factors:
1. The global economy is not in a recession. 
2. There's no significant policy or regulation that heavily impacts the U.S. stock market.
3. Natural disasters or other non-financial catastrophic events do not heavily impact the global economy.
4. Technological growth and innovation continue at a steady rate.

1. P(The global economy is not in a recession)=0.85
2. P(No significant policy or regulation impacts U.S. stock market|The global economy is not in a recession)=0.75
3. P(No non-financial catastrophic events heavily impact the global economy|No significant policy or regulation impacts U.S. stock market, The global economy is not in a recession)=0.9
4. P(Technological growth and innovation continue at a steady rate|No non-financial catastrophic events heavily impact the global economy, No significant policy or regulation impacts U.S. stock market, The global economy is not in a recession)=0.92

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.85*0.75*0.9*0.92=0.528015

0.528015
