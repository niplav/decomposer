Necessary factors:
1. The Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011 is altered so as to enable a general election in 2023.
2. There is a political will to hold a general election in 2023.

1. P(The Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011 is altered so as to enable a general election in 2023)=0.5
2. P(There is a political will to hold a general election in 2023|The Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011 is altered so as to enable a general election in 2023)=0.4
Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.5*0.4=0.2
