Necessary factors:

1. Increase in global surface temperature contributing to overall melting of ice.
2. No significant influence from naturally occurring climate events such as El Nino, La Nina.
3. Lack of unusually extensive multi-year sea ice formation.
4. Effect of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to increase.

1. P(Increase in global surface temperature contributing to overall melting of ice) = 0.95
2. P(No significant influence from naturally occurring climate events such as El Nino, La Nina | Increase in global surface temperature contributing to overall melting of ice ) = 0.50
3. P(Lack of unusually extensive multi-year sea ice formation | No significant influence from naturally occurring climate events such as El Nino, La Nina, Increase in global surface temperature contributing to overall melting of ice) = 0.60
4. P(Effect of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to increase | Lack of unusually extensive multi-year sea ice formation, No significant influence from naturally occurring climate events such as El Nino, La Nina, Increase in global surface temperature contributing to overall melting of ice) = 0.99
Multiplying the probabilities gives us: 0.95*0.50*0.60*0.99 = 0.28221
0.28221
