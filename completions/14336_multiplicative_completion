Necessary factors:
1. Labour Party appeals to a broader section of the populace
2. Conservative Party imposes unpopular policies / faces internal instability
3. External developments (e.g., economic, societal, international events) negatively impact perceptions of current government performance
4. Interval until 1 January 2024 is devoid of any significant Labour scandal

1. P(Labour Party appeals to a broader section of the populace)=0.4
2. P(Conservative Party imposes unpopular policies / faces internal instability|Labour Party appeals to a broader section of the populace)=0.5
3. P(External developments negatively impact perceptions of current government performance|Conservative Party imposes unpopular policies, Labour Party appeals to a broader section)=0.6
4. P(Interval devoid of significant Labour scandal|External developments negatively impact perceptions, Conservative Party imposes unpopular policies, Labour Party appeals to a broader section)=0.7

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.4*0.5*0.6*0.7 = 0.084
0.084
