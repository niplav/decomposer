5. The cease-fire is respected and major violations do not occur that would lead to its termination before January 1, 2024.

1. P(Russia and Ukraine are willing to negotiate a cease-fire)=0.35
2. P(An international mediator is willing and able to facilitate those negotiations|Russia and Ukraine are willing to negotiate)=0.90
3. P(The terms of a potential cease-fire are acceptable to both Russia and Ukraine | Russia and Ukraine are willing to negotiate, An international mediator is available)=0.45
4. P(The cease-fire is formally agreed upon, signed and starts before January 1, 2024 | The terms of the potential cease-fire are acceptable to both Russia and Ukraine, Russia and Ukraine are willing to negotiate, International mediator is available)=0.60
5. P(The cease-fire is respected and major violations do not occur before January 1, 2024 | The cease-fire is formally agreed upon, signed and starts before January 1, 2024, The terms of the potential cease-fire are acceptable to both Russia and Ukraine, Russia and Ukraine are willing to negotiate, An international mediator is available)=0.70

Multiplying out the probabilities: 
0.35*0.90*0.45*0.60*0.70=0.044415
