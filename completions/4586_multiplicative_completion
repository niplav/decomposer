Necessary factors:
1. Joe Biden is elected as president.
2. Biden administration prioritizes ending the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine.
3. A Bill that ends the sentencing disparity is introduced in Congress.
4. The Bill passes the House of Representatives.
5. The Bill passes the Senate.
6. The Bill is signed into law by President Biden.

1. P(Joe Biden is elected as president)=1 (Biden has already been inaugurated as President.)
2. P(Biden administration prioritizes ending the sentencing disparity|Joe Biden is elected as president)=0.8 (Based on Biden's campaign and early actions.)
3. P(A Bill is introduced in Congress|Biden Administration prioritizes ending the sentencing disparity, Joe Biden is elected as president)=0.9 (Biden's influence and control over his party should facilitate introduction of the necessary legislation.)
4. P(The Bill passes the House of Representatives|A Bill is introduced, Biden Administration prioritizes ending the sentencing disparity, Joe Biden is elected as president)=0.85 (Democrats control the House, and they typically support criminal justice reform.)
5. P(The Bill passes the Senate|The Bill passes the House, A Bill is introduced, Biden Administration prioritizes ending the disparity, Joe Biden is elected)=0.6 (The Senate is split 50-50 and contentious issues often face opposition.)
6. P(The Bill is signed into law by President Biden|The Bill passes the Senate, The Bill passes the House, A Bill is introduced, Biden Administration prioritizes ending the disparity, Joe Biden is elected)=0.99 (There is little reason to assume Biden would veto the legislation.)

Multiplying out the probabilities: 1*0.8*0.9*0.85*0.6*0.99=0.367416
0.367416
