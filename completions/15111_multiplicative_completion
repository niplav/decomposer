Necessary and sufficient factors:

1. Ukraine engages in a military conflict with Russia to regain lost territory.
2. Ukraine emerges victorious in the conflict.
3. Ukraine is able to maintain control over Simferopol post-conflict.
4. No major international powers intervene in a way that prevents Ukrainian control over Simferopol. 
5. All transitions of authority are completed before January 1, 2024. 

Conditional probabilities:

1. P(Ukraine engages in a military conflict with Russia to regain lost territory) = 0.20
2. P(Ukraine emerges victorious in the conflict | Ukraine engages in a military conflict with Russia to regain lost territory) = 0.35
3. P(Ukraine is able to maintain control over Simferopol post-conflict | Ukraine emerges victorious in the conflict) = 0.90
4. P(No major international powers intervene | Ukraine is able to maintain control over Simferopol post-conflict) = 0.70
5. P(All transitions of authority are completed before January 1, 2024 | No major international powers intervene) = 0.80

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.20 * 0.35 * 0.90 * 0.70 * 0.80 = 0.0396

0.0396
