Necessary factors:
1. H5N1 mutations allow easy human-to-human transmission.
2. Global health response measures are not sufficient to contain the spread.
3. The mortality rate of H5N1 keeps the current rate in humans.
4. Rapid population spreading of H5N1 virus occurs.

1. P(H5N1 mutations allow easy human-to-human transmission)=0.01
2. P(Global health response measures are not sufficient to contain the spread|H5N1 mutations allow easy human-to-human transmission)=0.2 
3. P(The mortality rate of H5N1 keeps the current rate in humans|Global health response measures are not sufficient to contain the spread, H5N1 mutations allow easy human-to-human transmission)=0.8
4. P(Rapid population spreading of H5N1 virus occurs|The mortality rate of H5N1 keeps the current rate in humans, Global health response measures are not sufficient to contain the spread, H5N1 mutations allow easy human-to-human transmission)=0.1

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.01*0.2*0.8*0.1=0.0016
0.0016
