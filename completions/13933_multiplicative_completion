Necessary factors:
1. A conflict escalates to war where one or more parties possess nuclear weapons.
2. Nuclear escalation - a decision is made to use nuclear weapons in the conflict.
3. Successful deployment - the nuclear weapon is successfully deployed without interception.
4. Impact and lethality - the deployed nuclear weapon successfully detonates in a populated area.

1. P(A conflict escalates to war where one or more parties possess nuclear weapons)=0.1
2. P(Nuclear escalation| A conflict escalates to war where one or more parties possess nuclear weapons)=0.05
3. P(Successful deployment|Nuclear escalation, A conflict escalates to war where one or more parties possess nuclear weapons)=0.9
4. P(Impact and lethality|Successful deployment, Nuclear escalation, A conflict escalates to war where one or more parties possess nuclear weapons)=0.95

Multiplying out the probabilities 0.1*0.05*0.9*0.95=0.004275.
