Necessary factors:
1. There is a newly mutated strain of influenza which is highly contagious.
2. The vaccine distribution is less than expected or the vaccine is not effective against the new strain.
3. The population has a low level of immunity from the previous flu season.
4. The healthcare system is stressed, reducing ability to manage outbreaks.

1. P(There is a newly mutated strain of influenza which is highly contagious)=0.15
2. P(The vaccine distribution is less than expected or the vaccine is not effective against the new strain|There is a newly mutated strain of influenza which is highly contagious)=0.25
3. P(The population has a low level of immunity from the previous flu season|The vaccine distribution is less than expected or the vaccine is not effective against the new strain, There is a newly mutated strain of influenza which is highly contagious)=0.4
4. P(The healthcare system is stressed, reducing ability to manage outbreaks|The population has a low level of immunity from the previous flu season, The vaccine distribution is less than expected or the vaccine is not effective against the new strain, There is a newly mutated strain of influenza which is highly contagious)=0.5

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.15*0.25*0.4*0.5 = 0.0075

0.0075
