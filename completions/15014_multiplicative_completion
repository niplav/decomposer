1. P(Kevin McCarthy continues to serve as a House Representative or similar position)=0.95
2. P(Kevin McCarthy desires to visit Taiwan in 2023|Kevin McCarthy continues to serve as a House Representative)=0.25
3. P(The U.S.'s political and diplomatic relations with Taiwan remain stable and safe for travel|Kevin McCarthy desires to visit Taiwan in 2023, Kevin McCarthy continues to serve as a House Representative)=0.8
