Necessary factors:
1. Full eradication of the COVID-19 virus globally.
2. Decline of demand and necessity for COVID-19 therapeutics.
3. Other treatments or prevention measures (like vaccination) become significantly more effective and widely used than current therapeutics.
4. U.S. FDA decision to withdraw authorization/approval of all COVID-19 therapeutics.

1. P(Full eradication of the COVID-19 virus globally) = 0.2
2. P(Decline of demand and necessity for COVID-19 therapeutics|Full eradication of the COVID-19 virus globally) = 0.9
3. P(Other treatments or prevention measures become significantly more effective and widely used than current therapeutics|Decline of demand and necessity for COVID-19 therapeutics, Full eradication of the COVID-19 virus globally) = 0.85
4. P(U.S. FDA decision to withdraw authorization/approval of all COVID-19 therapeutics|Other treatments or prevention measures become significantly more effective and widely used than current therapeutics, Decline of demand and necessity for COVID-19 therapeutics, Full eradication of the COVID-19 virus globally) = 0.7

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.2*0.9*0.85*0.7=0.1071
0.1071
