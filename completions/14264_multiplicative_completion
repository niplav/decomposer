1. P(Further adoption and use of Bitcoin)=0.7
2. P(Positive regulatory environment|Further adoption and use of Bitcoin)=0.6
3. P(Steady or positive global economic outlook|Positive regulatory environment, Further adoption and use of Bitcoin)=0.6
4. P(No severe negative incidents or security breaches related to Bitcoin|Steady or positive global economic outlook, Positive regulatory environment, Further adoption and use of Bitcoin)=0.8

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.7*0.6*0.6*0.8=0.2016
