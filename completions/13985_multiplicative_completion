Necessary factors:
1. At least one major third party broker (e.g. UN, USA, EU) involves itself in the negotiation of the cease-fire or peace agreement.
2. Both Russia and Ukraine agree to cease-fire negotiations.
3. An agreement is reached and a cease-fire or peace agreement is established.
4. The cease-fire or peace agreement holds for 30 days.

1. P(At least one major third party broker involves itself in the negotiation)=0.80
2. P(Both Russia and Ukraine agree to negotiations|At least one major third-party broker involves itself in the negotiation)=0.65
3. P(An agreement is reached and established|Both Russia and Ukraine agree to negotiations, A major third party broker involves itself in the negotiation)=0.6
4. P(The cease-fire or peace agreement holds for 30 days|An agreement is reached and established, Both Russia and Ukraine agree to negotiations, A major third party broker involves itself in the negotiation)=0.7
Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.80*0.65*0.6*0.7=0.2184
0.2184
