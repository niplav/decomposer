Necessary factors:
1. An audit revelation showing Tether reserves holding risky assets.
2. A broader market downturn that leads to a significant "run on the bank."
3. A regulatory crackdown targeting stablecoins and particularly Tether due to its market dominance.
4. Tether's inability to maintain 1:1 backing with USD due to the combined effect of above factors.

1. P(An audit revelation showing Tether reserves holding risky assets) = 0.4
2. P(A broader market downturn that leads to a significant "run on the bank" | An audit revelation showing Tether reserves holding risky assets) = 0.6
3. P(A regulatory crackdown targeting stablecoins and particularly Tether due to its market dominance | An audit revelation showing Tether reserves holding risky assets, A broader market downturn that leads to a significant "run on the bank") = 0.4
4. P(Tether's inability to maintain 1:1 backing with USD due to the combined effect of above factors | An audit revelation showing Tether reserves holding risky assets, A broader market downturn that leads to a significant "run on the bank", A regulatory crackdown targeting stablecoins and particularly Tether due to its market dominance) = 0.5

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.4 * 0.6 * 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.048
0.048
