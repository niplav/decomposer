Necessary factors:
1. Technical issues within Twitter's infrastructure leading to a complete outage.
2. Failure in immediate recovery and continuity plans, extending the outage to more than 60 minutes.

1. P(Technical issues within Twitter's infrastructure leading to a complete outage)=0.05
2. P(Failure in immediate recovery and continuity plans, extending the outage to more than 60 minutes|Technical issues within Twitter's infrastructure lead to a complete outage)=0.1

Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.05*0.1=0.005

0.005
