Necessary factors:
1. Ali Khameini's health deteriorates significantly.
2. There is a politically viable successor available.
3. Iran's political elites agree on the successor.

1. P(Ali Khameini's health deteriorates significantly)=0.35
2. P(There is a politically viable successor available|Ali Khameini's health deteriorates significantly)=0.85
3. P(Iran's political elites agree on the successor|There is a politically viable successor available, Ali Khameini's health deteriorates significantly)=0.75
Multiplying out the probabilities: 0.35*0.85*0.75=0.223125
0.223125
